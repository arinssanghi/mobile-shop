# mobile-shop
The objective is to define a small mobile shop’s system for Sales and purchase of mobiles, where the detail of purchasing of mobiles of different models at which price is stored and in which price the mobiles are sold to the customers, both details are stored for the query for any mobile handsets. I include two small applications that are Notepad and Calculator, which is commonly used during the sales or purchasing. 

In start I introduce a form to request for the menu which holds several options for the sales and purchasing are available. This is the starting form so all other forms are connected to it by simple connection.

During purchasing, I request for the model-id and its image for the recognized. This form accepts Mobile mode-id and its image to store and using this form it help to find that is same model-id is exists or not if exists then you can modify or complaint about it.

After adding the Mobile model-id, you have to add the entire feature that is available in that Mobile. This form helps to add feature of Mobile through the available list of features. This form also helps to change or remove the feature of the Mobile.

If any time there is needed to store and retrieve the information about the supplier then I created its solution that helps you to store supplier id and its basic information.

On purchasing the Mobile handsets, customer information is required then customer detail form will use.

To store the information all of above I mention and generating the report I used the Ms - Access -11 versions to store and crystal report to display the report. Ms-Access providing database facilities in arranged manner and its using for the new developer are quite easy. This Access consist the multiple data tables in the one database file so multiple information is easy to access and store without using more memory.
 
Database – To store all the questions, their answer for competition, to store all the answers by the group in each round, for printing their results I used the Ms - Access -11 versions. Ms-Access providing database facilities in arranged manner and its using for the new developer are quite easy. This Access consist the multiple data tables in the one database file so multiple information is easy to access and store without using more memory. 

Feasibility study (System Analysis & Design)
     			
The Primary objective of this Feasibility report is to inform the user about the following matters:-
	Operational Feasibility
	Technical Feasibility
	Economical Feasibility

Non Functional Requirements

Reliability:
 The Software starts cleanly after a crash, and it will not corrupt any persistent information (such as the records) in the event of a crash. 

Maintainability:
Testing and refining has been incorporated from the very first phase of development life cycle of Mobile Shop Project, so as to make it more maintainable. Cleaned simple system documentation is provided so that the System can easily be understood and extended in further enhancements and it is easily extensible.
